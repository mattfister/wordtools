# wordtools
This package contains some utility classes for various linguistic tasks.

It also contains some vocabulary lists in the words folder. These can be accessed via wordLists or names.

It also contains a reduced version of conceptnet that can be searched based on JSON representation located in the
conceptnetreduced folder. These have been reduced in order to get under the git file size limit and to remove unneeded
parts (for my use cases). Only the concepts and relations remain, and all languages other than English have been
removed.
